# this recipe assumes that plurals.csv and new_phrases.txt have been updated to include the complete set of singular-plural pairs and ngrams to be tokenized respectively.  

# TODO -- this should be rewritten to:

1) process the no--ngrams fully
2) then run an adapted bin/process_10_grams.pl to replace words in place_docs_here/world-docs-nongrams.tsv

python bin/comma_to_tab.py world-trans.csv > world-trans.tsv

## filter data, add bigrams, set the "Manager" field

# stupid comments ids aren't unique -- need to add a unique id to them for this all to work

perl -w bin/process_world_no_ngrams.pl ../place_docs_here/reloaded_world.tsv > ../place_docs_here/reloaded_world_ided.tsv

# no ngrams version -- dedupe code now in the process file
# need to run these first, because they generate the list of ids 
# to kill off 10-grams
