sick feeling whenever i hear management comments about changing ibm so it is like other companies ibms uniqueness was one of the things that made it special and attracted talented personnel i am glad to see the focus on the needs of customers again now the company needs to also focus on the employees like they were family who will in turn focus on the customers i remember when the company treated the employees as family and how the employees would bend over backwards to make the customers happy we took pride in our work and didnt just work for a pay check so ibm needs to value its employees if it wants to really become a great company again also management needs to carefully evaluate how their decisions will affect the employees and their morale for example how do you think an employee would feel if he now has to work 42 years instead of 30 to get the same retirement and depending on interest rates maybe longer,  5
